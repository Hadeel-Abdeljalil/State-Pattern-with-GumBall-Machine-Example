# **Gumball Machine - State Pattern Example**

This repository contains an implementation of the **State Pattern** through a classic **Gumball Machine** example, inspired by the _"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"_ book by the **Gang of Four**.

## **Overview**
The Gumball Machine example demonstrates how to manage the state of an object (a gumball machine) in a dynamic way by encapsulating the behaviors associated with different states into separate state classes. The machine transitions between the following states:

- **No Quarter State**: No coin has been inserted.
- **Has Quarter State**: A coin has been inserted.
- **Sold State**: The gumball is being dispensed.
- **Sold Out State**: The machine is out of gumballs.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Java**
- **Object-Oriented Design Principles**
- **State Design Pattern**

## **Features**
- Illustrates the State Pattern with a real-world scenario.
- Clean separation of concerns by using different state classes.
- Demonstrates dynamic state transitions based on user actions.
